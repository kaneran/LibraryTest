For C# we usually put unit tests into a separate project. 
By doing this you separate production code (which gets shipped), and test code (which does not).
Therefore, keep the size of the artifact down, separation of concerns, and fewer dependencies in the 
Prod code.

In other languages test code is located side by side with the prod code (Angular). There are aguments for it
e.g. easier to manager a test if its right next to the prod code. But with Angular the test code will not be
made part of the final artifact when transpiled (webpack.js ?)
